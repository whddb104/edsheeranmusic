<strong>Lyrics</strong>
<p>When your legs don't work like they used to before<br>

And I can't sweep you off of your feet<br>

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love<br>

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks<br>

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
</p>
<p>And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>

Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>

Oh me I fall in love with you every single day<br>

And I just wanna tell you I am
</p>
<p>So honey now
Take me into your loving arms<br>

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>

Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
</p>
Maybe we found love right where we are<br>

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades<br>

And the crowds don't remember my name<br>

When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
</p>
<p>'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen<br>

Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory<br>

I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>

Maybe it's all part of a plan<br>

I'll just keep on making the same mistakes<br>

Hoping that you'll understand<br>

But baby now
</p>
<p>Take me into your loving arms<br>

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>

Place your head on my beating heart<br>

I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh<br>

</p>
<p>So baby now<br>

Take me into your loving arms<br>

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>

Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart<br>

I'm thinking out loud
</p>
<p>That maybe we found love right where we are<br>

Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)<br>

</p>And we found love right where we are<br>
