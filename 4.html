<p><strong>Lyrics</strong>
<p>When I was six years old I broke my leg<br>

I was running from my brother and his friends<br>
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down<br>
I was younger then, take me back to when I<br>
</p>
<p>Found my heart and broke it here<br>

Made friends and lost them through the years<br>
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown<br>
But I can't wait to go home<br>
</p>
<p>I'm on my way<br>

Driving at 90 down those country lanes<br>
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"<br>
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real<br>
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill<br>
</p>
<p>Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes<br>

Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends<br>
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right<br>
But I was younger then, take me back to when<br>
<p>
<p>We found weekend jobs, when we got paid<br>

We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight<br>
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown<br>
But I can't wait to go home<br>
</p>
<p>I'm on my way<br>

Driving at 90 down those country lanes<br>
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"<br>
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real<br>
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill<br>
</p>
<p>Over the castle on the hill<br>

Over the castle on the hill<br>
One friend left to sell clothes<br>
One works down by the coast<br>
One had two kids but lives alone<br>
One's brother overdosed<br>
One's already on his second wife<br>
One's just barely getting by<br>
But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home<br>
</p>
<p>And I'm on my way, I still remember<br>

These old country lanes<br>
When we did not know the answers<br>
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real<br>
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill<br>
Over the castle on the hill<br>
</p>Over the castle on the hill<br>
