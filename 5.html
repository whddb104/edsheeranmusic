<p><strong>Lyrics</strong></p>
<p>I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill<br>
I threw the day old tea from the cup<br>
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made<br>
Memories of a life that's been loved<br>
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals<br>
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink<br>
Dad always told me, "don't you cry when you're down"
</p>
<p>But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink<br>
Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know<br>
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved<br>
So I'll sing Hallelujah<br>
You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br>
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up<br>
Spread your wings as you go<br>
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah<br>
You're home
</p>
<p>I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up<br>
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case<br>
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek<br>
And wiped a tear from the side of my face<br>
I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know<br>
A life with love is a life that's been lived<br>
</p>
<p>So I'll sing Hallelujah<br>
You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br>
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up<br>
Spread your wings as you go<br>
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah<br>
You're home
</p>
<p>Hallelujah<br>
You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br>
You got to see the person that I have become<br>
Spread your wing<br>
And I know that when God took you back he said Hallelujah<br>
</p>You're home
