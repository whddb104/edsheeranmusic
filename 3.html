<p><strong>Lyrics</strong>
<p>Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes<br>
But it's the only thing that I know<br>
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes<br>
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive<br>
We keep this love in a photograph
</p>
<p>We made these memories for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are never closing<br>
Hearts are never broken<br>
And time's forever frozen still<br>
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br>
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
</p>
<p>And if you hurt me<br>
That's okay baby, only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages you just hold me<br>
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home<br>
Love can heal, loving can mend your soul<br>
And it's the only thing that I know, know
</p>
<p>I swear it will get easier,<br>
Remember that with every piece of you<br>
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die<br>
You can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen<br>
Next to your heartbeat where I should be<br>
Keep it deep within your soul
</p>
<p>When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me<br>
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street<br>
Hearing you whisper through the phone,<br>
</p>"Wait for me to com/e home"<br>
