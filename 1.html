<p><strong>Lyrics</strong></p>

  <p>I found a love for me<br>
  Darling, just dive right in<br>
  And follow my lead<br>
  Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
  </p>I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
<p>
  <p>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
  Not knowing what it was<br>
  I will not give you up this time<br>
  Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
  And in your eyes, you're holding mine
</p>
  <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
  Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song<br>
  When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
  But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
<p>
  <p>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
  She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
  I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
  To carry love, to carry children of our own
</p>
  <p>We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
  Fightin' against all odds<br>
  I know we'll be alright this time<br>
  Darling, just hold my hand<br>
  Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
  I see my future in your eyes
</p>
  <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
  Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song<br>
  When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
  I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
</p>
  <p>Oh, no, no<br>
  Mm
</p>
  <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
  Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
  I have faith in what I see
  Now I know I have met an angel in person
  And she looks perfect
  No, I don't deserve this
  </p>You look perfect tonight
